My JavaScript Learning Journey ðŸš€

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I document my JavaScript learning adventure! ðŸŽ‰

I'm following along with Thapa Technical tutorials, and as I learn new concepts, I'll be sharing the code here for each topic I cover. This repository serves as a growing collection of my progress, from the basics to advanced JavaScript topics.

ðŸ“š What You'll Find Here:
- JavaScript Concepts: Step-by-step code examples of topics Iâ€™m learning.
- Thapa Technical Tutorials: All code here follows the learning path provided by Thapa Technical.
- Hands-on Practice: My solutions and practice code for each topic.

Feel free to explore, fork, or contribute to this journey. Any feedback or suggestions are always welcome!
